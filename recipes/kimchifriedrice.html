    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This simple, simple dish is super, super tasty. It's just a few ingredients, but itâ€™s a dish much loved by Koreans and a staple of our everyday lives.</p>
    <p>This version is simple, but you can dress it up with a bit of beef, chicken, pork, ham, or even spam. Many Koreans also like to put a fried egg on top, but my family prefers this simple version that I'm showing you here.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 bowls steamed rice</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped kimchi</li>
            <li>2-3 tablespoons gochujang</li>
        </ul>
